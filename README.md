# Overview

This repository is for documenting my path learning the erlang functional programming language. I wanted to learn this language to increase my marketability.

Because this is an exploration of a new language, I plan to include useful links that could help to explain the code.

A 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code focused on what I learned about the language and syntax.

# Development Environment

I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the erlang extension to develop this.

[Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/) is a functional programming language. This means that it uses pattern matching and immutability. For more information about the [Erlang Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)).
